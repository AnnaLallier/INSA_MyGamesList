Von den Spielemagazinen wurde es mit guten Wertungen bedacht (z. B. PC Player 87 %, Gamestar 88 %, PC Games 86 %).\nJedoch war es zu Beginn geradezu gefÃ¼llt mit Bugs, was von der Spielergemeinde kritisiert wurde. Dennoch wurde es von den Anstoss-Fans mit Begeisterung aufgenommen, da es die wichtigsten Elemente von Anstoss 2 Gold enthielt und diese noch weiter vertiefen konnte.\nAls besonders gelungen gilt die 3D-Spieldarstellung. Der Spieler konnte sich ein komplettes Spiel seines Teams reduziert auf neun Minuten ansehen. Auch der Szenenmodus galt als revolutionÃ¤r, da die Szenen nicht, wie in den VorgÃ¤ngerteilen, vorberechnet wurden. Kommentiert wurden die Spielszenen durch den bekannten FuÃballkommentator GÃ¼nther Koch.\nAuch neu war die Umsetzung des VereinsgelÃ¤ndes. Von ApfelbÃ¤umen Ã¼ber Konditionsparcours und Doping-Labor bis hin zu Wolkenkratzern konnte der Spieler sein VereinsgelÃ¤nde mit GebÃ¤uden, GegenstÃ¤nden und Lebewesen mit und ohne Nutzen erweitern.\nMit der VerÃ¶ffentlichung des finalen Patches auf Version 1.40 wurde es nahezu bugfrei und konnte die Anstoss-Spieler Ã¼berzeugen. Insgesamt wurden bis heute Ã¼ber eine Million Exemplare von Anstoss 3 verkauft und machen es damit zu einem der erfolgreichsten PC-Spiele Deutschlands. Trotz seines Alters wird Anstoss 3 durch die groÃe Spieltiefe zusammen mit einem gelungenen Text- und 3D-Modus als bester Teil der Anstoss-Reihe angesehen. Dass Anstoss 3 auch heute noch sehr beliebt ist, hÃ¤ngt auch mit dem Multiplayermodus zusammen. So wird es bis zu 4 Spielern ermÃ¶glicht, im Netzwerk gegeneinander anzutreten.",
